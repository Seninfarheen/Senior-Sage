Here are a few basic rules of golf:\n\n1. **Objective**: Get the ball into the hole in the fewest strokes possible.\n2. **Teeing Off**: Start each hole from the tee box. You can use a tee for your first stroke.\n3. **Taking Turns**: The player farthest from the hole hits first.\n4. **Counting Strokes**: Count each stroke you take with the club.\n5. **Out of Bounds**: If your ball goes out of bounds, you add a penalty stroke and hit again from where you last played.\n\nWould you like to know more about any specific part of the game?"
